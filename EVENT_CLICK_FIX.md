# Event Click Modal Fix - Calendar View

## Issue
When clicking an event on the calendar-view page, the event details modal was not showing up.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Missing `StateHasChanged()` calls after modal state changes
2. Incomplete modal CSS styles in the component
3. Missing form element styles
4. Insufficient logging in event click handling

## Changes Made

### 1. CalendarView.razor (C# Code)
- Added `StateHasChanged()` calls in `OnEventClick` method to force UI updates
- Enhanced logging in `OnEventClick` to track event click handling
- Enhanced logging in `ShowEventDetails` to track modal state changes
- Added logging for event not found scenarios

### 2. fullcalendar-interop.js
- Enhanced event click logging with console output
- Added promise handling with success/error callbacks
- Added detailed event information logging (ID and title)

### 3. CalendarView.razor (CSS Styles)
Added complete modal and form styles:
- **Modal Overlay & Container**: Proper z-index (9999) and positioning
- **Modal Animations**: fadeIn and slideUp animations
- **Form Grid Layout**: 2-column grid with full-width support
- **Form Labels**: Styled with icons and required indicators
- **Form Controls**: Hover effects and focus states
- **Toggle Switches**: Complete toggle slider implementation
- **Button Styles**: Primary, secondary, danger, and outline variants
- **Event Details Grid**: Styled detail sections and badges
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded by status (scheduled, completed, cancelled, in progress)
- **Invitation Rows**: Flexbox layout for name/email inputs
- **Responsive Design**: Maintained existing responsive breakpoints

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - API
cd EventScheduler.Api
dotnet run

# Terminal 2 - Web
cd EventScheduler.Web
dotnet run
```

### 2. Test Event Click Functionality
1. Navigate to `/calendar-view`
2. Wait for calendar to load with events
3. Click on any event in the calendar
4. **Expected Result**: Event details modal should appear showing:
   - Event title
   - Description (if available)
   - Date & Time (formatted properly)
   - Location (if available)
   - Event type badge
   - Status badge
   - Public/Private indicator
   - Edit/Delete buttons (if you're the organizer)
   - Join button (if it's a public event and you're not the organizer)
   - Close button

### 3. Check Browser Console
Open browser developer tools (F12) and check console for:
```
Event clicked: { id: X, title: "Event Name" }
OnEventClick completed successfully
```

### 4. Check Server Logs
Look in the terminal for:
```
CalendarView: Event clicked - {EventId}
CalendarView: ShowEventDetails called for event: {EventTitle} (ID: {EventId})
CalendarView: Event details modal should now be visible. showDetailsModal = True
```

### 5. Test Modal Interactions
- Click **Edit** button (if organizer): Should close details modal and open edit modal
- Click **Delete** button (if organizer): Should delete event and refresh calendar
- Click **Join** button (if public event): Should add you as participant
- Click **Close** button: Should close the modal
- Click outside modal (on overlay): Should NOT close (by design)
- Press **Escape**: Should NOT close (by design - can be added if needed)

### 6. Test Other Calendar Features
Ensure the fix didn't break existing functionality:
- Create new event (click on date or drag to select date range)
- Drag and drop events to reschedule
- Resize events to change duration
- Click "New Event" button in header

## Additional Features Available
- Real-time updates via SignalR (check connection status banner)
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
- Loading states with spinner animations
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Modal Still Not Showing
1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Check server logs** for C# exceptions
3. **Verify event ID** is being parsed correctly (should be integer)
4. **Clear browser cache** and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. **Check z-index conflicts** - modal overlay should be at z-index 9999

### Modal Shows But Content Missing
1. **Check if `selectedEvent` is null** in logs
2. **Verify event data** has all required properties
3. **Check for CSS conflicts** with other components

### Styling Issues
1. **Check if Bootstrap Icons** are loaded (should see icons)
2. **Verify app.css** is included in layout
3. **Check for CSS specificity issues** in browser inspector

## Known Limitations
1. The `confirm()` method is simplified - should implement proper confirmation dialog with JSInterop
2. `JoinEvent()` is a placeholder - needs proper API endpoint implementation
3. Participant checking is not fully implemented

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add keyboard shortcuts (Escape to close modal)
2. Add click-outside-to-close functionality
3. Implement proper confirmation dialogs with JSInterop
4. Add participant management for events
5. Add event sharing functionality
6. Add calendar export/import features

## Files Modified
1. `EventScheduler.Web/Components/Pages/CalendarView.razor` (C# code + CSS)
2. `EventScheduler.Web/wwwroot/js/fullcalendar-interop.js`

## No Breaking Changes
All existing functionality remains intact. This is purely an enhancement/fix.
