# Synchronization Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the synchronization fixes implemented to address duplicate events, offline sync issues, and real-time update conflicts in the EventScheduler application.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Duplicate Events When Creating Online ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** When creating an event while online, the event would sometimes appear twice - once from the optimistic UI update and again from the SignalR broadcast.

**Root Cause:** Time-based duplicate detection (`lastLocalOperationTime`) was unreliable due to network latency and timing variations.

**Solution:** Replaced with ID-based tracking using `optimisticallyAddedEventIds` HashSet:
```csharp
// When creating event
optimisticallyAddedEventIds.Add(createdEvent.Id);

// In SignalR handler
if (optimisticallyAddedEventIds.Remove(eventData.Id)) {
    // Skip - already added optimistically
}
```

### 2. Temporary Offline Events Creating Duplicates After Sync ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Events created offline with temporary IDs would persist in cache even after sync, creating duplicates alongside the real server events.

**Root Cause:** No mechanism to map temporary IDs to real server IDs and clean up temporary events.

**Solution:** Implemented `tempIdToRealIdMap` Dictionary and automatic cleanup:
```csharp
// Store temp ID in pending operation
var operation = new PendingOperation {
    Type = "create",
    TempId = tempId  // Negative ID
};

// After sync, map temp to real
await NotifyTempIdMapped(tempId, realId);

// UI replaces temp event with real event
var tempEvent = events.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == tempId);
events.Remove(tempEvent);
events.Add(realEvent);
```

### 3. Inefficient Operations on Temporary Events ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Updating or deleting temporary events (not yet synced) would create unnecessary pending operations.

**Root Cause:** No special handling for operations on temporary events.

**Solution:** Smart operation merging:

**For Updates:**
```csharp
if (eventId < 0) { // Temporary event
    // Find pending create and merge update into it
    var createOp = pendingOps.FirstOrDefault(op => op.TempId == eventId);
    // Merge update fields into create request
    // No separate update operation needed
}
```

**For Deletes:**
```csharp
if (eventId < 0) { // Temporary event
    // Just remove the pending create operation
    await _offlineStorage.RemovePendingOperationAsync(createOp.Id);
    // No need to send delete to server for event that was never created
}
```

### 4. Cache and Server State Divergence ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** After sync, cache could still contain temporary events or be missing newly synced events.

**Root Cause:** Incomplete cache cleanup after sync operations.

**Solution:** 
- Automatic removal of temporary events from cache after sync
- Comprehensive event reload after sync completes
- Proper cache updates during network transitions

### 5. SignalR and Local Updates Conflicting ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** SignalR broadcasts could interfere with local optimistic updates, causing inconsistent UI state.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient tracking of local vs. remote operations.

**Solution:** Multi-layered duplicate prevention:
1. Track optimistically added events
2. Track pending local changes
3. Check for existing events before adding
4. Proper event ID mapping for offline scenarios

## Architecture Changes

### New Data Structures

```csharp
public class CalendarView {
    // Tracks events added optimistically (prevents duplicates from SignalR)
    private readonly HashSet<int> optimisticallyAddedEventIds = new();
    
    // Maps temporary offline IDs to real server IDs
    private readonly Dictionary<int, int> tempIdToRealIdMap = new();
    
    // Tracks pending local changes (updates/deletes)
    private readonly HashSet<int> pendingLocalChanges = new();
}

public class PendingOperation {
    public int? TempId { get; set; }  // NEW: For tracking temporary offline events
}
```

### New Events & Handlers

```csharp
public class OfflineSyncService {
    // NEW: Notifies UI when temp ID is mapped to real ID
    public event Func<int, int, Task>? OnTempIdMapped;
}
```

### Enhanced Logic Flow

#### Creating Event Online:
1. Call API → Get real event with server ID
2. Add event to UI immediately (optimistic update)
3. Track event ID in `optimisticallyAddedEventIds`
4. SignalR broadcasts "EventCreated"
5. Check if ID is in `optimisticallyAddedEventIds`
6. If yes → Skip (already displayed)
7. If no → Add (from another user/tab)

#### Creating Event Offline:
1. Generate negative temporary ID
2. Create PendingOperation with TempId
3. Add temp event to cache and UI
4. When online → Sync operation
5. API returns real event with server ID
6. Notify UI: `OnTempIdMapped(tempId, realId)`
7. UI replaces temp event with real event
8. Remove temp event from cache

#### Updating Temporary Event:
1. Check if eventId < 0 (temporary)
2. Find pending create operation
3. Merge update into create request
4. Save merged operation
5. Update local cache
6. When synced → Single create sent with all updates

#### Deleting Temporary Event:
1. Check if eventId < 0 (temporary)
2. Find and remove pending create operation
3. Remove from local cache
4. No server sync needed
