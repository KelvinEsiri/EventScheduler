# üéØ ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED!

## üîç The Problem

**Root Cause:** Port mismatch between configuration and actual API server.

### What Logs Revealed:
```
SignalR: ‚ùå HTTP connection failed - Could not reach API server
SocketException (10061): No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
```

This meant the API server was NOT running on the port we were trying to connect to.

### Investigation Results:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5005
# Result: (empty - nothing on port 5005)

netstat -ano | findstr :5006
# Result: TCP 127.0.0.1:5006 LISTENING (API is here!)
```

**Discovery:** 
- Code was configured to connect to: **port 5005**
- API was actually running on: **port 5006**

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### Files Updated:

1. **CalendarView.razor**
   - Changed: `var apiBaseUrl = "http://localhost:5005";`
   - To: `var apiBaseUrl = "http://localhost:5006";`

2. **EventScheduler.Web/Program.cs**
   - Changed: `BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:5005")`
   - To: `BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:5006")`

3. **EventScheduler.Api/Program.cs**
   - Updated log messages to show correct port 5006

## üöÄ WHAT TO DO NOW

### Option 1: Just Refresh the Page (Recommended)

Since the Web server is still running, simply:
1. **Go to your browser**
2. **Press F5** (or Ctrl+R) to refresh
3. **That's it!**

The Web app will hot-reload with the new port configuration.

### Option 2: Restart Web Server

If refresh doesn't work:
1. Stop the Web server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run: `dotnet run` in EventScheduler.Web folder
3. Reload browser

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

After refreshing, you should see:

**Browser:**
- üü¢ **Green bar:** "Connected to real-time updates"

**Web Terminal Logs:**
```
InitializeSignalR: Connecting to hub at: http://localhost:5006/hubs/events
SignalR: ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Successfully connected! Connection ID: <guid>
SignalR: Connection State: Connected
```

**API Terminal Logs:**
```
========================================
‚úÖ SignalR: Client connected!
Connection ID: <guid>
========================================
```

---

## üß™ Test It!

1. **Refresh the calendar page**
2. **Check the connection status** (should be green)
3. **Open a second browser window** (Chrome + Edge)
4. **Create an event in one**
5. **Watch it appear in the other!**

---

## üìä Why This Happened

The **launchSettings.json** file in the API project specifies:
```json
"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5006"
```

But the code was hardcoded to use port **5005**.

This mismatch caused the connection failure.

---

## üéâ Summary

**Problem:** Wrong port number (5005 instead of 5006)
**Solution:** Updated all references to use port 5006
**Action:** Refresh browser or restart Web server
**Expected:** Green "Connected" message and real-time sync!

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED - Port mismatch resolved**
**Action:** **Refresh your browser now!**
