# Offline Mode Implementation

## What's New

EventScheduler now works offline! You can create, edit, and delete events even without an internet connection. When you reconnect, all your changes will be automatically synchronized.

## Key Features

✅ **Work Offline** - Continue using the app when your connection drops
✅ **Auto-Sync** - Changes sync automatically when you reconnect
✅ **Visual Status** - See your connection status with the wifi icon
✅ **No Data Loss** - All offline changes are saved and synced

## How It Works

### When Online (Normal Mode)
- Events load from the server
- Changes save immediately
- Real-time updates via SignalR
- Everything works as usual

### When Offline
- Events load from local cache
- Changes are queued for later
- You see a wifi-off icon
- All operations still work in the UI

### When Reconnecting
- Automatic sync starts
- Queued changes are sent to server
- Fresh data is downloaded
- Wifi icon returns to normal

## User Interface

### Network Status Indicator
Located in the top-right corner of Calendar View and other pages:
- **Green wifi icon** - Online and connected
- **Red wifi-off icon** - Offline mode

### Pending Changes Badge (coming soon)
Shows count of operations waiting to sync.

## Technical Implementation

### Services Added

1. **OfflineStorageService**
   - Stores events in browser using IndexedDB
   - Manages pending operations queue
   - Persists data across page reloads

2. **NetworkStatusService**
   - Monitors browser online/offline status
   - Notifies app when status changes
   - Uses native browser APIs

3. **OfflineSyncService**
   - Coordinates offline mode
   - Manages synchronization
   - Handles pending operations

### Storage

**IndexedDB** is used to store:
- Cached events (for offline viewing)
- Pending operations (create, update, delete)
- Timestamps for sync ordering

### JavaScript Modules

- `offline-storage.js` - IndexedDB operations
- `network-status.js` - Network monitoring

## Code Changes Summary

### New Files
- `Services/OfflineStorageService.cs` - Offline storage management
- `Services/NetworkStatusService.cs` - Network status monitoring  
- `Services/OfflineSyncService.cs` - Sync orchestration
- `wwwroot/js/offline-storage.js` - IndexedDB wrapper
- `wwwroot/js/network-status.js` - Network detection
- `docs/OFFLINE_FUNCTIONALITY.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files
- `Program.cs` - Register new services
- `ApiService.cs` - Add offline fallback hooks
- `App.razor` - Include new JavaScript files

### Documentation Cleanup
Cleaned up comments in:
- `ApiService.cs` - Removed verbose XML comments
- `CalendarView.razor.cs` - Removed redundant inline comments
- `Program.cs` - Simplified configuration comments
- `reconnection-handler.js` - Streamlined headers

## Testing

### Simulate Offline Mode
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Select "Offline" from throttling dropdown
4. Try creating/editing events
5. Go back online
6. Watch changes sync automatically

### Browser Console
Monitor offline operations in console:
```
[OfflineStorage] Saved 10 events to offline storage
[NetworkStatus] Network status: Offline
[OfflineSync] Event queued for creation offline
[NetworkStatus] Network status: Online
[OfflineSync] Synchronizing pending changes...
[OfflineSync] Synced operation: create
[OfflineSync] Synchronization completed successfully
```

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support IndexedDB:
- Chrome/Edge ✅
- Firefox ✅
- Safari ✅
- Mobile browsers ✅

## Known Limitations

1. **No real-time updates offline** - SignalR requires connection
2. **Simple conflict resolution** - Last write wins
3. **No offline authentication** - Must be logged in before going offline

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Show pending operations count in UI
- [ ] Manual sync trigger button
- [ ] Better conflict resolution
- [ ] Service Worker for true offline-first
- [ ] Background sync

## Migration Notes

No database migrations or API changes required. This is purely client-side functionality that enhances the user experience without affecting the backend.

## Support

If you encounter issues with offline mode:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Clear browser cache and reload
3. Ensure you're using a modern browser
4. Check IndexedDB in DevTools
