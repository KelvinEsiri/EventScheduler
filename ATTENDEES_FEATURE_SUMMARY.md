# Attendees Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the "Created By" feature to include an **Attendees system** that tracks who has joined public events, with a visual indicator for joined events and a participants list display.

## New Changes

### 1. Database Schema - EventAttendee Entity

**New Entity: EventAttendee.cs**
- `Id` (int) - Primary key
- `EventId` (int) - Foreign key to Event
- `UserId` (int) - Foreign key to User
- `JoinedAt` (DateTime) - When the user joined the event

**Relationships:**
- Many-to-many junction table between Events and Users
- Unique constraint on (EventId, UserId) - user can only join once
- Cascade delete on both Event and User

### 2. Entity Updates

**Event Entity:**
- Added `Attendees` collection navigation property (ICollection<EventAttendee>)

**User Entity:**
- Added `AttendingEvents` collection navigation property (ICollection<EventAttendee>)

**DbContext:**
- Added `EventAttendees` DbSet
- Configured EventAttendee relationships with unique composite index

### 3. DTOs

**New: EventAttendeeResponse.cs**
```csharp
- Id (int)
- UserId (int)
- UserName (string)
- UserEmail (string?)
- JoinedAt (DateTime)
```

**Updated: EventResponse.cs**
- Added `Attendees` (List<EventAttendeeResponse>?)

### 4. Service Logic Updates

**JoinPublicEventAsync:**
- Now does TWO things:
  1. Adds user to the **original public event's attendees list**
  2. Creates a copy of the event in user's personal calendar
- Checks if user already in attendees before adding
- Updates the public event entity with new attendee

**LeaveEventAsync:**
- Removes user from the **original public event's attendees list**
- Deletes the user's personal copy of the event
- Both actions happen atomically

**MapToResponse:**
- Added `Attendees` mapping from EventAttendee entities
- Includes full user details (name, email, join date)
- **ParticipantsCount logic updated:**
  - Public events: Count based on `Attendees`
  - Private events: Count based on `Invitations`

### 5. Repository Updates

**EventRepository:**
- Added `.Include(e => e.Attendees).ThenInclude(a => a.User)` to:
  - `GetPublicEventsAsync()`
  - `GetPublicEventByIdAsync()`
- Ensures attendee information is loaded with full user details

### 6. UI Changes

**CalendarList.razor:**
- Added "Joined" badge for events where `IsJoinedEvent == true`
- Badge has green color scheme with calendar-check icon
- Displays alongside Status, Type, and Public badges

**PublicEvents.razor:**
- Added Attendees section in event details modal
- Shows list of all users who joined the event
- Each attendee shows:
  - Name with person-check icon
  - Join date
  - Styled with green accent color

**CSS Updates (calendar.css):**
```css
.joined-badge {
    background: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.1);
    color: #10b981;
}
```

## Feature Flow

### When User Joins a Public Event:

1. **User clicks "Join Event"** on a public event
2. **Backend creates EventAttendee record:**
   - Links user to the original public event
   - Records join timestamp
   - Updates public event's Attendees collection
3. **Backend creates event copy:**
   - All details copied to user's calendar
   - `IsPublic = false` (private copy)
   - `OriginalEventId` set to link back
   - `CreatedByUserName` stored
4. **UI updates:**
   - "Join Event" button → "Leave Event" button
   - User's copy shows "Joined" badge
   - Public event's participant count increases
   - User appears in attendees list

### When User Leaves a Public Event:

1. **User clicks "Leave Event"**
2. **Backend removes EventAttendee record:**
   - User removed from public event's attendees
   - Public event updated
3. **Backend deletes event copy:**
   - User's personal copy removed
4. **UI updates:**
   - "Leave Event" button → "Join Event" button
   - Participant count decreases
   - User removed from attendees list

## Visual Indicators

### In User's Calendar (CalendarList):
- **Joined events** show a green "Joined" badge
- Badge appears alongside other badges (Status, Type, Public)
- Icon: `bi-calendar-check`

### In Public Events (PublicEvents):
- **Participants count** shows total attendees
- **Attendees section** lists all users who joined:
  - User's full name
  - Join date
  - Green check icon
  - Light purple background

## Key Benefits

1. **Dual Tracking System:**
   - Attendees list on public event (for creator visibility)
   - Personal copy in user's calendar (for convenience)

2. **Clear Visual Feedback:**
   - "Joined" badge immediately shows event origin
   - Attendees list shows community engagement

3. **Accurate Participant Count:**
   - Public events: Based on actual attendees who joined
   - Private events: Based on invitations sent

4. **Better Event Discovery:**
   - Users can see who else is attending
   - Creates social proof for popular events

## API Behavior

### Joining Public Events:
- `POST /api/events/public/{id}/join`
- Creates EventAttendee record
- Returns the user's event copy (not the public event)
- IdEmpotent: Won't create duplicate if already joined

### Leaving Public Events:
- `POST /api/events/public/{id}/leave`
- Removes EventAttendee record
- Deletes user's event copy
- Returns success

### Public Event Queries:
- `GET /api/events/public`
- `GET /api/events/public/{id}`
- Both include full attendees list with user details
- ParticipantsCount reflects attendees

## Database Migration

**Migration Name:** `AddEventAttendeesTable`

Creates:
- EventAttendees table
- Composite unique index on (EventId, UserId)
- Foreign key relationships with cascade delete

## Testing Checklist

- [x] User can join a public event
- [x] EventAttendee record created when joining
- [x] User's copy shows "Joined" badge
- [x] Participants count updates correctly
- [x] Attendees list displays in modal
- [x] User can leave a public event
- [x] EventAttendee record removed when leaving
- [x] Participants count decreases
- [x] Cannot join same event twice
- [x] Multiple users can join same event
- [x] Attendees shown with name and join date

## Notes

- The **Invitations** system is still used for private events
- The **Attendees** system is exclusively for public events
- Users get both:
  - A record in the public event's attendees
  - A private copy in their personal calendar
- This dual approach provides:
  - Social visibility (attendees list)
  - Personal convenience (event in their calendar)
