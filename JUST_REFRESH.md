# âš¡ QUICK FIX - Just Refresh Your Browser!

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Wrong
Your code was trying to connect to **port 5005**, but the API is running on **port 5006**.

## âœ… What I Fixed
Changed all port references from **5005** â†’ **5006** to match your running API server.

## ðŸš€ What You Need to Do

### Just refresh your browser!
1. Go to your browser with the calendar open
2. Press **F5** or **Ctrl+R**
3. Done!

The Blazor hot-reload should pick up the changes automatically.

## ðŸŽ‰ Expected Result

You should now see:
- âœ… **Green bar:** "Connected to real-time updates"
- âœ… No more red error message

And SignalR will work!

## ðŸ§ª Quick Test

1. Open calendar in two browser windows
2. Create an event in one
3. Watch it appear in the other instantly!

---

**That's it! Just refresh and it should work now.** ðŸŽŠ
