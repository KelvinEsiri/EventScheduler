## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch (if used)
- Feature branches - `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix branches - `fix/bug-name`
- Hotfix branches - `hotfix/issue-name`

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local repository
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. **Make your changes** in your feature branch
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly
3. **Commit your changes** following commit guidelines
4. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Keeping Your Branch Updated

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch
git rebase upstream/main

# Force push if needed (only for your own branches)
git push origin feature/your-feature-name --force
```

## Coding Standards

### C# Coding Conventions

Follow Microsoft's [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).

**Key Points:**
- Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and properties
- Use camelCase for local variables and parameters
- Use meaningful and descriptive names
- One class per file
- Use `var` when the type is obvious
- Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

**Example:**
```csharp
// Good
public class TaxCalculationService
{
    private readonly ILogger<TaxCalculationService> _logger;

    public TaxCalculationService(ILogger<TaxCalculationService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task<TaxCalculationResult> CalculateTaxAsync(decimal income)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// Avoid
public class taxcalculation
{
    public decimal calc(decimal i)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Project Structure

- Place entities in `NasosoTax.Domain/Entities`
- Place DTOs in `NasosoTax.Application/DTOs`
- Place services in `NasosoTax.Application/Services`
- Place repositories in `NasosoTax.Infrastructure/Repositories`
- Place controllers in `NasosoTax.Api/Controllers`
- Place Blazor pages in `NasosoTax.Web/Components/Pages`

### Dependency Injection

- Always use constructor injection
- Register services in `Program.cs`
- Use appropriate lifetimes (Transient, Scoped, Singleton)

```csharp
// Good
public class TaxController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ITaxCalculationService _taxService;

    public TaxController(ITaxCalculationService taxService)
    {
        _taxService = taxService;
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

- Use try-catch blocks where appropriate
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Return meaningful error messages
- Use proper HTTP status codes

```csharp
try
{
    var result = await _service.ProcessAsync(request);
    return Ok(result);
}
catch (ValidationException ex)
{
    _logger.LogWarning(ex, "Validation failed for request");
    return BadRequest(new { error = ex.Message });
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Unexpected error processing request");
    return StatusCode(500, new { error = "An error occurred" });
}
```

### Logging

- Use structured logging with Serilog
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Use appropriate log levels

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("Calculating tax for user {UserId} with income {Income}", 
    userId, income);

_logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to calculate tax for user {UserId}", userId);
```

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Example:**
```
feat(tax-calc): add monthly income toggle feature

- Added IsMonthlyIncome property to TaxCalculationRequest
- Updated calculator UI with toggle switch
- Added automatic annualization (monthly Ã— 12)
- Added visual indicators for mode

Closes #123
```

### Good Commit Practices

- **Make atomic commits** - One logical change per commit
- **Write clear messages** - Explain what and why, not how
- **Reference issues** - Use `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
- **Keep commits focused** - Don't mix unrelated changes

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test individual components in isolation
- Use mocking for dependencies
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Write meaningful test names

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task CalculateTax_WithValidIncome_ReturnsCorrectTax()
{
    // Arrange
    var service = new TaxCalculationService();
    var income = 5000000m;

    // Act
    var result = service.CalculateTax(income, new List<DeductionDetail>());

    // Assert
    Assert.NotNull(result);
    Assert.Equal(expected, result.TotalTax);
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Use test database
- Clean up test data
- Test error scenarios

### Manual Testing

Before submitting:
1. Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Test on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
3. Test error scenarios
4. Test edge cases
