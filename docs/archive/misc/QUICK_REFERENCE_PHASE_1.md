# Quick Reference: Phase 1 Implementation

## ✅ What Was Done

### 🎯 Main Achievement
**Removed direct service injection from frontend - Tax calculations now go through API**

---

## 📁 Files Changed

1. **TaxDTOs.cs** - Added `TaxCalculationRequest`
2. **TaxController.cs** - Added `POST /api/tax/calculate` endpoint
3. **Calculator.razor** - Refactored to use API
4. **SubmitIncome.razor** - Refactored to use API

---

## 🔗 New API Endpoint

```
POST /api/tax/calculate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "totalIncome": 5000000,
  "deductions": [
    {
      "deductionType": "Pension",
      "description": "Annual pension contribution",
      "amount": 200000
    }
  ]
}

Response: 200 OK
{
  "totalIncome": 5000000,
  "totalDeductions": 200000,
  "taxableIncome": 4800000,
  "totalTax": 686000,
  "effectiveTaxRate": 13.72,
  "netIncome": 4314000,
  "bracketCalculations": [...],
  "deductionDetails": [...]
}
```

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Option 1: Browser
1. Run: `dotnet run` in NasosoTax.Web folder
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/calculator`
3. Enter income: 5,000,000
4. Click "Calculate Tax"
5. Verify result displays correctly

### Option 2: Postman/cURL
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tax/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "totalIncome": 5000000,
    "deductions": [
      {
        "deductionType": "Pension",
        "amount": 200000
      }
    ]
  }'
```
