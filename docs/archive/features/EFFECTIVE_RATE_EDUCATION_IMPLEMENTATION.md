## 📚 **What is Effective Tax Rate?**

**Definition**: The effective tax rate is the actual percentage of your total income that goes to taxes.

**Formula**: `(Total Tax Paid ÷ Total Income) × 100`

**Why It Matters**: Because Nigeria uses progressive taxation, your effective rate is typically lower than your highest tax bracket rate.
