### 2. Backend Integration

#### Request Model (UseLedgerForTaxRequest)
```csharp
{
    "taxYear": 2025,
    "month": 10,
    "additionalIncome": 0,
    "deductions": [
        {
            "deductionType": "Pension",
            "description": "Pension contribution",
            "amount": 50000
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Response Model (TaxCalculationResult)
```csharp
{
    "totalIncome": 500000.0,
    "totalDeductions": 50000,
    "taxableIncome": 450000.0,
    "totalTax": 0.000,
    "effectiveTaxRate": 0.00,
    "netIncome": 500000.000,
    "bracketCalculations": [...],
    "deductionDetails": [...]
}
```

### 3. Business Logic

The service:
1. Retrieves all income entries for the specified user, year, and month
2. Sums up all income entries marked as "Income" type
3. Adds any additional income provided
4. Applies all deductions
5. Calculates tax using Nigeria Tax Act 2025 brackets
6. Returns detailed breakdown including bracket-by-bracket calculation

## Testing Results

```bash
# Setup
- Ledger Income: â‚¦500,000 (October 2025)
- Additional Income: â‚¦0
- Deduction: â‚¦50,000 (Pension)

# Result
- Taxable Income: â‚¦450,000
- Tax: â‚¦0 (below â‚¦800,000 threshold)
- Effective Rate: 0%
```

### Test Case 2: Higher Income with Multiple Brackets
```bash
# Setup
- Ledger Income: â‚¦650,000 (October 2025)
- Additional Income: â‚¦4,500,000
- Deductions: â‚¦450,000 (Pension â‚¦400k + NHIS â‚¦50k)

# Result
- Total Income: â‚¦5,150,000
- Taxable Income: â‚¦4,700,000
- Tax: â‚¦636,000
- Effective Rate: 12.35%
- Bracket Breakdown:
  - First â‚¦800,000 at 0% = â‚¦0
  - Next â‚¦2,200,000 at 15% = â‚¦330,000
  - Next â‚¦1,700,000 at 18% = â‚¦306,000
```
