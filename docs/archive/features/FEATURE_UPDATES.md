# Feature Updates Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the recent feature updates and bug fixes implemented in the NasosoTax application.

## Date: January 2025

---

## 1. General Ledger Authentication Fix

### Issue
The General Ledger page was redirecting users to the login page even when they were authenticated.

### Solution
- **File Modified**: `NasosoTax.Web/Components/Pages/Ledger.razor`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `forceLoad: true` parameter to `NavigateTo()` to force a full page reload
  - Added early authentication check in `OnInitializedAsync()` with clear error message
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

### Impact
- Users can now access the General Ledger page when authenticated
- Better error messages when authentication fails
- Improved user experience with clearer feedback

---

## 2. Tax Submission Edit Functionality

### Issue
Users could not edit tax year income submissions after initial submission, even if the submission had not been processed.

### Solution Implemented

#### A. Backend Changes

##### Domain Layer
- **File Modified**: `NasosoTax.Domain/Entities/TaxRecord.cs`
- **Added Field**: `IsProcessed` (boolean, default: false)
- **Purpose**: Track whether a tax record has been officially processed

##### Application Layer
- **Interface Modified**: `NasosoTax.Application/Interfaces/ITaxRecordService.cs`
- **New Methods Added**:
  - `GetTaxRecordByIdAsync(int userId, int taxYear)` - Retrieve specific tax record for editing
  - `DeleteTaxRecordAsync(int userId, int taxYear)` - Delete unprocessed records
  - `MarkAsProcessedAsync(int userId, int taxYear)` - Mark a record as officially processed

- **Service Modified**: `NasosoTax.Application/Services/TaxRecordService.cs`
- **Implementations**:
  - `GetTaxRecordByIdAsync` - Fetches record with all related income sources and deductions
  - `DeleteTaxRecordAsync` - Only allows deletion if `IsProcessed = false`
  - `MarkAsProcessedAsync` - Sets `IsProcessed = true` and prevents further edits
  - `SubmitIncomeAndDeductionsAsync` - Updated to support both create and update operations

- **DTOs Modified**: `NasosoTax.Application/DTOs/ReportDTOs.cs`
- **Fields Added**:
  - `IsProcessed` to `TaxSummaryResponse`
  - `IsProcessed` to `TaxYearSummary`

- **Service Updated**: `NasosoTax.Application/Services/ReportService.cs`
- **Changes**: Maps `IsProcessed` field in all tax summaries

##### Web/API Layer
- **Controller Modified**: `NasosoTax.Web/Controllers/TaxController.cs`
- **New Endpoints Added**:
  1. `GET /api/tax/record/{taxYear}` - Get specific tax record for editing
  2. `DELETE /api/tax/record/{taxYear}` - Delete unprocessed tax record
  3. `POST /api/tax/record/{taxYear}/process` - Mark tax record as processed
- **Validation**: All endpoints include input validation and authorization checks

#### B. Frontend Changes

##### Submit Income Page
- **File Modified**: `NasosoTax.Web/Components/Pages/SubmitIncome.razor`
- **New Features**:
  - Added route parameter: `/submit-income/{TaxYear:int?}` for edit mode
  - **Edit Mode Detection**: Automatically detects when navigated with a tax year parameter
  - **Data Loading**: Loads existing tax record data when in edit mode
  - **UI Indicators**:
    - Info banner showing "Editing Tax Information for {Year}"
    - Conditional header text: "Update Tax Information" vs "Submit Tax Information"
    - Conditional button text: "Update Tax Information" vs "Submit Tax Information"
  - **Success/Error Messages**:
    - Success alert (green) after successful submission/update
    - Error alert (red) when operations fail
    - Warning alert (yellow) for validation issues
  - **Auto-population**: All form fields automatically populate with existing data in edit mode

##### Reports Page
- **File Modified**: `NasosoTax.Web/Components/Pages/Reports.razor`
- **New Features**:
  - Added "Status" column showing "Processed" or "Draft" badges
  - **Edit Button**: 
    - Appears only for unprocessed (draft) records
    - Styled with warning color (yellow) to indicate editability
    - Includes pencil icon for visual clarity
    - Navigates to edit mode: `/submit-income/{taxYear}`
  - **Status Badges**:
    - Green "Processed" badge for finalized records
    - Yellow "Draft" badge for editable records
  - **Detail View Status**: Shows processing status in the detail card header

#### C. Database Changes
- **Migration Created**: `UpdateTaxRecordWithIsProcessed`
- **Changes**: Added `IsProcessed` column to `TaxRecords` table with default value `false`
- **Status**: Migration applied successfully to database

### Business Rules
1. **Edit Permission**: Users can only edit tax records where `IsProcessed = false`
2. **Delete Permission**: Users can only delete tax records where `IsProcessed = false`
3. **Process Lock**: Once a record is marked as processed, it cannot be edited or deleted
4. **Update vs Create**: System automatically determines whether to create new or update existing record

### User Workflow
1. User submits tax information → Record created with `IsProcessed = false` (Draft)
2. User can edit the draft submission via Reports page → Click "Edit" button
3. Form loads with existing data → User modifies as needed → Click "Update"
4. Admin marks record as processed → `IsProcessed = true` (Locked)
5. Edit button no longer appears → Record is finalized and cannot be modified

## 3. UI Response Messages Enhancement

### Issue
Users were not receiving adequate feedback when performing operations in the UI.

### Solution

#### Success Messages
- **Color**: Green (`alert-success`)
- **Triggers**:
  - Successful tax information submission
  - Successful tax information update
  - Successful data save operations
- **Duration**: Displayed until user navigates away or dismisses

#### Error Messages
- **Color**: Red (`alert-danger`)
- **Triggers**:
  - API call failures
  - Authentication errors
  - Validation failures
  - Network issues
- **Content**: Clear, actionable error descriptions

#### Warning Messages
- **Color**: Yellow (`alert-warning`)
- **Triggers**:
  - Validation warnings
  - Draft status indicators
- **Purpose**: Inform users of non-critical issues

#### Implementation Details
- **Location**: Top of relevant pages/forms
- **Style**: Bootstrap alerts with dismissible option
- **Conditional Rendering**: Messages only appear when relevant
- **Auto-clear**: Messages clear on new operations

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] **General Ledger Access**
  - Login and navigate to General Ledger
  - Verify page loads without redirect
  - Test with expired session

- [ ] **Tax Submission - Create**

  - Test with expired session
  - Test with network disconnected
  - Verify appropriate error messages

### API Testing
```bash
# Get tax record for editing
GET /api/tax/record/2024
Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Update tax record
POST /api/tax/submit
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Body: { ...tax data... }
