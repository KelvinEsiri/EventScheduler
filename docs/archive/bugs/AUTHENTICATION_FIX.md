# Authentication Persistence Fix for Blazor Server

## Problem Summary
Pages were being redirected to the login page after successful authentication. The internal logs showed that users could successfully login, but navigating to protected pages (like `/ledger`, `/submit-income`, `/reports`) would result in a 302 redirect back to `/login`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that **each page navigation in Blazor Server creates a new `AuthStateProvider` instance**, and the authentication state was not being persisted across these instance creations.

### Technical Details
1. Login happens via SignalR/WebSocket in one circuit
2. Page navigation triggers an HTTP GET request, potentially creating a new circuit
3. New circuit gets a new scoped `AuthStateProvider` instance
4. The new instance had no knowledge of the authentication that happened in the previous circuit
5. `IsAuthenticated()` returned `false`, causing redirects to login page

From the logs:
```
[18:43:17 INF] AuthStateProvider instance created: f2bab215
[18:43:17 INF] IsAuthenticated check in instance f2bab215: False, Identity: null, AuthType: null
[18:43:18 INF] HTTP GET /ledger responded 302 in 1511.9748 ms
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `AuthStateCache` Singleton Service
A thread-safe singleton service that stores authentication state in memory:
```csharp
public class AuthStateCache
{
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, AuthCacheEntry> _cache = new();
    // Methods: SetAuthState, GetAuthState, ClearAuthState
}
```

### 2. Session-Based Cache Keys
- Each browser session gets a unique ID stored in HTTP session storage
- This session ID is used as the cache key
- The session ID persists across page navigations and circuit reconnections
- Session cookies ensure the same session ID is used throughout the user's browsing session

### 3. Updated `AuthStateProvider`
Modified to restore authentication state from cache on initialization:
```csharp
public AuthStateProvider(ILogger<AuthStateProvider> logger, 
    IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor, 
    AuthStateCache authStateCache)
{
    // ...
    RestoreFromCache(); // Immediately restore state if available
}
```

### 4. Authentication Flow
1. **Login:** User submits credentials →  Authentication succeeds → State saved to cache with session ID
2. **Page Navigation:** New HTTP GET request → New `AuthStateProvider` created → Retrieves session ID from cookie → Restores authentication state from cache using session ID
3. **Result:** `IsAuthenticated()` returns `true`, page loads successfully

## Files Modified
- `NasosoTax.Web/Services/AuthStateCache.cs` (new)
- `NasosoTax.Web/Services/AuthStateProvider.cs`
- `NasosoTax.Web/Program.cs`
- `NasosoTax.Web/Components/Pages/Login.razor`
- `NasosoTax.Web/Components/Pages/Logout.razor`

## Configuration Changes
Added session support in `Program.cs`:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
builder.Services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromHours(24);
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
});

// Register singleton cache
builder.Services.AddSingleton<Services.AuthStateCache>();
```

## Testing
The solution was verified using:
- Direct API testing with curl (successful)
- Internal log analysis showing proper state restoration
- Multiple AuthStateProvider instance creation scenarios

## Minimal Changes Approach
The solution follows the "minimal changes" principle:
-  No changes to existing authentication logic or JWT implementation
- No changes to protected pages (Ledger, Reports, SubmitIncome)
- No database schema changes
- Only added a caching layer to persist state

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add cache expiration cleanup background task
2. Consider using `IDistributedCache` for multi-server scenarios
3. Add metrics/logging for cache hit rates
4. Implement sliding expiration for better security

## Notes
- The session timeout is set to 24 hours, matching typical web application patterns
- The cache automatically expires entries after 24 hours
- Session cookies are HTTP-only and marked as essential for security
- The solution works in both single-server and (with modifications) multi-server deployments
