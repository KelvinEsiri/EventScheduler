## Why Archived?

These documents were created during active development to track specific issues, implementations, and fixes. They have been archived because:

1. **Information is outdated** - The code has evolved beyond these specific fixes
2. **Consolidated into main docs** - Key information has been integrated into:
   - [OFFLINE_MODE_GUIDE.md](../OFFLINE_MODE_GUIDE.md)
   - [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - [CALENDAR_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../CALENDAR_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
3. **Temporary nature** - These were quick reference documents for specific development tasks

## When to Reference

These documents may be useful for:
- Understanding the evolution of specific features
- Investigating historical bugs or decisions
- Learning about specific implementation challenges and solutions
- Tracking the development timeline
