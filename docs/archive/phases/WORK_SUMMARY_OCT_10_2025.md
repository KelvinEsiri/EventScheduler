# Work Summary - October 10, 2025

## Issues Reported by User

1. **General Ledger entry did not show** after adding
2. **Tax year dropdown should be blank** when the page loads
3. **Years list is too long**, needs to be shorter with slider

---

## Work Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. Fixed General Ledger Entry Display Issue

**Problem**: Entries weren't displaying after being added to the ledger.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced null checking at multiple levels in the display condition
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track data flow
- Implemented `StateHasChanged()` to force UI updates
- Improved error messages with detailed exception information
- Better empty state messaging

**Code Changes** (`Ledger.razor`):
```csharp
// Before:
@if (ledgerSummary?.Entries.Any() == true)

// After:
@if (ledgerSummary != null && ledgerSummary.Entries != null && ledgerSummary.Entries.Any())

// Added logging:
Console.WriteLine($"Ledger loaded: {ledgerSummary.Entries?.Count ?? 0} entries found");
StateHasChanged(); // Force UI update
```

### 2. Fixed Tax Year Dropdown - Blank on Load

**Problem**: Dropdown pre-selected current year instead of being blank.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed default TaxYear from `DateTime.Now.Year` to `0`
- Added placeholder option "-- Select Tax Year --"
- Updated validation to check for year selection

**Code Changes** (`SubmitIncome.razor`):
```csharp
// Before:
private IncomeSubmissionRequest request = new() 
{ 
    TaxYear = DateTime.Now.Year,
    // ...
};

// After:
private IncomeSubmissionRequest request = new() 
{ 
    TaxYear = 0, // Start with no year selected
    // ...
};

// Added placeholder:
<option value="0">-- Select Tax Year --</option>
```

### 3. Fixed Tax Year Dropdown - Reduced Year List with Scrolling

**Problem**: Too many years (2000 to present), overwhelming dropdown.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Reduced year range from 26+ years to just 12 years
- Shows: (Current Year + 1) down to (Current Year - 10)
- Added CSS for scrollable dropdown with max-height
- Maintained smooth user experience

**Code Changes** (`SubmitIncome.razor`):
```csharp
// Before:
@for (int year = DateTime.Now.Year + 1; year >= 2000; year--)
{
    <option value="@year">@year</option>
}

// After:
<select style="max-height: 250px; overflow-y: auto;">
    <option value="0">-- Select Tax Year --</option>
    @for (int year = DateTime.Now.Year + 1; year >= DateTime.Now.Year - 10; year--)
    {
        <option value="@year">@year</option>
    }
</select>

// For 2025, this shows: 2026, 2025, 2024, ..., 2015 (12 years total)
```

## Testing Instructions

### For General Ledger:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5070/ledger
2. Fill in the entry form:
   - Select date
   - Choose "Income" or "Expense"
   - Enter category (e.g., "Salary")
   - Enter amount (e.g., 50000)
   - Add description
3. Click "Add Entry"
4. **Expected**: Entry appears in the table immediately
5. Check browser console (F12) for debug logs
6. Verify summary totals update correctly

### For Tax Year Dropdown:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5070/submit-income
2. **Expected**: "-- Select Tax Year --" shown by default
3. Open the dropdown
4. **Expected**: See 12 years (2026 down to 2015 in 2025)
5. **Expected**: Dropdown scrolls if list is long
6. Try to submit without selecting a year
7. **Expected**: Error message "Please select a valid tax year."

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Console Logging**: Debug logs use `Console.WriteLine()` - only visible in browser dev tools
2. **Scrolling CSS**: May need adjustment for different screen sizes
3. **Year Range**: Fixed to 10 years - not configurable yet

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow):
1. **Test the fixes** manually with the instructions above
2. **Add database indexes** for performance (see SPRINT_1_ACTION_PLAN.md)
3. **Move secrets to environment variables** for security
4. **Add rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### This Week:
1. Add health check endpoint
2. Implement Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
3. Start writing unit tests
4. Improve error messages

### Next Sprint (2 weeks):
1. Migrate from SQLite to SQL Server/PostgreSQL
2. Comprehensive unit test coverage (50%+)
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Implement Application Insights monitoring
