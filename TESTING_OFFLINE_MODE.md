# Testing Guide: Offline Mode Fix

This guide explains how to test the offline mode implementation fix to verify that users can navigate between pages while offline without seeing the reconnection spinner.

## Prerequisites

1. Start both API and Web servers:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - API Server
   cd EventScheduler.Api
   dotnet run
   
   # Terminal 2 - Web Server  
   cd EventScheduler.Web
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Open browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5292`

3. Login to the application

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Offline Navigation (PRIMARY FIX)

**Expected Behavior**: Navigate between pages while offline WITHOUT seeing reconnection spinner

**Steps:**
1. Login and navigate to Calendar View (`/calendar-view`)
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Set throttling to "Offline"
5. Click navigation links: Home ‚Üí Calendar List ‚Üí Calendar View ‚Üí Public Events
6. Navigate back and forth multiple times

**‚úÖ SUCCESS**: You can navigate between pages without seeing the "Attempting to reconnect to the server..." spinner

**‚ùå FAIL**: Reconnection spinner appears when navigating offline

**Console Output (Expected)**:
```
üì¥ [SignalR] User is offline - skipping reconnection UI
```

### Scenario 2: Create Event Offline

**Expected Behavior**: Create events while offline, they should queue for sync

**Steps:**
1. Set browser to Offline mode (DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Offline)

3. Click "New Event" button
4. Fill in event details:
   - Title: "Test Offline Event"
   - Date/Time: Tomorrow at 10 AM
5. Click "Create"

**‚úÖ SUCCESS**: 
- Event appears in calendar immediately
- Toast message: "Event created offline - will sync when online"
- Event stored in IndexedDB

**‚ùå FAIL**: 
- Error message appears
- Event doesn't show in calendar

**Console Output (Expected)**:
```
[OfflineStorage] Added pending operation: create for event null
[OfflineStorage] Saved X events to offline storage
```

---

### Scenario 3: Edit Event Offline

**Expected Behavior**: Edit existing events while offline, changes queue for sync

**Steps:**
1. Ensure some events exist in calendar

### Scenario 5: Sync When Back Online

**Expected Behavior**: All offline changes sync automatically when network is restored

**Steps:**
1. While offline, create 2 events, edit 1 event, delete 1 event
2. Go to DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Change throttling from "Offline" to "No throttling"
4. Wait a few seconds

**‚úÖ SUCCESS**:
- Console shows: "[OfflineSync] Synchronizing pending changes..."
- Console shows: "[OfflineSync] Synced operation: create"
- All changes appear in other browser tabs/windows
- SignalR reconnects

**‚ùå FAIL**:

- Errors in console

**Console Output (Expected)**:
```
[NetworkStatus] Network status changed to Online
[OfflineSync] Synchronizing pending changes...
[OfflineSync] Found X pending operations to sync
[OfflineSync] Synced operation: create
[OfflineSync] Synced operation: update
[OfflineSync] Synced operation: delete
[OfflineSync] Synchronization completed successfully
üü¢ [SignalR] Connection restored!
```

### Scenario 6: Server Down (But Online)

**Expected Behavior**: Reconnection spinner SHOULD show when server is down but user is online

**Steps:**
1. Ensure browser is NOT in offline mode
2. Stop the API server (Ctrl+C in API terminal)
3. Try to navigate to a different page

**‚úÖ SUCCESS**:
- Reconnection spinner appears: "Attempting to reconnect to the server..."
- Console shows polling attempts
- When API restarts, page reloads automatically

**‚ùå FAIL**:
- No spinner appears (should appear in this case!)

**Console Output (Expected)**:
```
üî¥ [SignalR] Connection lost (online) - starting active polling
üì° [SignalR] Polling server...
‚ùå [SignalR] Server still down, will retry...
üì° [SignalR] Polling server...
üü¢ [SignalR] Server is back! Reloading page...
```

### Scenario 7: Drag & Drop Offline

**Expected Behavior**: Move events by dragging while offline

**Steps:**
1. Set browser to Offline mode
2. Go to Calendar View
3. Drag an event to a different date/time
4. Drop the event

**‚úÖ SUCCESS**:
- Event moves immediately in calendar
- Toast message: "‚úÖ Event moved to [new date] (offline - will sync)"
- Change queued in IndexedDB

**‚ùå FAIL**:
- Event reverts to original position

### Scenario 8: View Cached Events

**Expected Behavior**: View previously loaded events while offline

**Steps:**
1. While online, load Calendar View (events are cached)
2. Set browser to Offline mode
3. Reload the page (Ctrl+R)
4. Navigate to Calendar List and back to Calendar View

**‚úÖ SUCCESS**:
- Events load from cache
- All previously viewed events are visible
- Can interact with cached events

**‚ùå FAIL**:
- No events show
- Loading spinner never stops
- Error messages

**Console Output (Expected)**:
```
[OfflineStorage] Retrieved X events from offline storage
[OfflineSync] Offline mode, loading from cache
```

## Monitoring Tools

### Browser Console
Press F12 and monitor these logs:
- `[SignalR]` - Connection status and reconnection attempts
- `[OfflineStorage]` - IndexedDB operations
- `[OfflineSync]` - Synchronization status
- `[NetworkStatus]` - Online/offline status changes

### IndexedDB Inspector
1. Press F12
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Expand "IndexedDB"
4. Expand "EventSchedulerOfflineDB"
5. View:
   - `events` store - Cached events
   - `pendingOperations` store - Queued changes

### Network Tab
1. Press F12
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Use throttling dropdown to simulate offline:
   - "Offline" - No network at all
   - "Slow 3G" - Test slow connections
   - "No throttling" - Normal speed

## Expected User Experience

### When Online (Normal)
- Events load instantly from server
- Changes save immediately
- Real-time updates via SignalR
- Green wifi icon in header
- No "offline" messages

### When Offline
- Events load from cache
- Can create/edit/delete events
- Changes queued for sync
- Red wifi-off icon in header
- Messages indicate "offline - will sync"
- **NO reconnection spinner when navigating**

### When Reconnecting
- Spinner shows if server is down (but online)
- Auto-sync starts when network restored
- Fresh data downloaded
- SignalR reconnects
- Real-time updates resume

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Events not loading offline
**Solution**: 
1. Check IndexedDB has data: F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí IndexedDB
2. Verify events were loaded while online first
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Changes not syncing when online
**Solution**:
1. Check console for sync errors
2. Verify API server is running
3. Check pending operations: F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí IndexedDB ‚Üí pendingOperations

### Issue: Reconnection spinner showing offline
**Solution**:
1. Verify browser is in offline mode: DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Offline
2. Check console for `navigator.onLine` value
3. This is the bug we fixed - if you see this, the fix didn't apply

### Issue: Can't navigate while offline
**Solution**:
1. This is the main bug we fixed
2. Verify reconnection-handler.js has the offline check
3. Check browser console for network status logs

---

## Success Criteria

All these should work:
- ‚úÖ Navigate between pages offline without spinner
- ‚úÖ Create events offline
- ‚úÖ Edit events offline
- ‚úÖ Delete events offline
- ‚úÖ Drag/drop events offline
- ‚úÖ Auto-sync when online
- ‚úÖ Spinner shows when server down (but online)
- ‚úÖ Load cached events offline
- ‚úÖ Proper user feedback for offline operations

---

## Notes

- The fix is **client-side only** - no database changes needed
- Browser must support IndexedDB (all modern browsers do)
- Must be logged in before going offline (no offline auth)
- Conflict resolution is simple: last write wins
- SignalR requires connection - no real-time updates offline
