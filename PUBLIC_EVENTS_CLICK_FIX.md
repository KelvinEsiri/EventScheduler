# Public Events Click Fix

## Issue
Public events were not displaying details when clicked from the calendar view. The modal would not appear when users clicked on events in the public events calendar.

## Root Cause
The `PublicEvents.razor` component was missing `StateHasChanged()` calls after updating the `selectedEvent` property. In Blazor Server with InteractiveServer render mode, UI updates need to be explicitly triggered when state changes occur from JavaScript interop callbacks.

## Solution
Added `StateHasChanged()` calls in three key methods:

### 1. OnEventClick Method
```csharp
[JSInvokable]
public Task OnEventClick(int eventId)
{
    var evt = events.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == eventId);
    if (evt != null)
    {
        ShowEventDetails(evt);
        StateHasChanged(); // Force UI update to show modal
    }
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

### 2. ShowEventDetails Method
```csharp
private void ShowEventDetails(EventResponse evt)
{
    selectedEvent = evt;
    StateHasChanged(); // Force UI update to show modal
}
```

### 3. CloseModal Method
```csharp
private void CloseModal()
{
    selectedEvent = null;
    StateHasChanged(); // Force UI update to hide modal
}
```

## Files Modified
- `EventScheduler.Web/Components/Pages/PublicEvents.razor`

## Why This Works
- **JavaScript Interop Context**: When `OnEventClick` is called from JavaScript via FullCalendar, Blazor doesn't automatically know the UI needs updating.
- **StateHasChanged()**: This method tells Blazor to re-render the component, checking for changes in properties like `selectedEvent`.
- **Modal Rendering**: The modal is conditionally rendered with `@if (selectedEvent != null)`, so when `selectedEvent` is set and `StateHasChanged()` is called, the modal appears.

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/public-events`
2. Click on "Calendar View" toggle
3. Click on any event in the calendar
4. The event details modal should now appear immediately
5. Click close or outside the modal to close it
6. Verify the modal closes properly

## Additional Notes
This fix aligns with the same pattern used in `CalendarView.razor`, which already had `StateHasChanged()` calls in its event handling methods. The public events calendar now has feature parity with the authenticated user calendar view.
