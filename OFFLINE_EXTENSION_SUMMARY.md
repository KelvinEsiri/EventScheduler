## Technical Architecture

### Service Integration

```
CalendarList Component
    │
    ├─► OfflineEventService (Offline-first CRUD)
    │       ├─► ApiService (When online)
    │       └─► LocalStorageService (When offline)
    │               └─► IndexedDB Manager (JavaScript)
    │
    ├─► ConnectivityService (Network monitoring)
    │       └─► Connectivity Manager (JavaScript)
    │
    └─► SyncService (Background sync)
            └─► Process pending operations when online
```

### Data Flow

**Offline Event Creation**:
1. User creates event → `OfflineEventService.CreateEventAsync()`
2. Check connectivity → Offline detected
3. Save to IndexedDB → Generate temporary ID
4. Queue operation → `SyncService.QueueOperationAsync()`
5. Show success → Event visible in UI immediately

**Online Sync**:
1. Connectivity restored → `ConnectivityService` fires event
2. SyncService triggers sync → Process pending operations
3. Create event on server → Get real server ID
4. Update local cache → Replace temporary data
5. Show "Synced" indicator → User notified

## Security Review

✅ **CodeQL Scan**: No security alerts found  
✅ **Code Review**: Completed with minor nitpick suggestions about code duplication (acceptable)

**Security Considerations**:
- Authentication tokens properly managed
- No sensitive data logged
- Proper error handling throughout
- IndexedDB data scoped per user
- No new security vulnerabilities introduced

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

#### ✅ Event List Offline Functionality
- [ ] Load Event List page while online
- [ ] Verify events display correctly
- [ ] Go offline (Chrome DevTools → Network → Offline)
- [ ] Verify events still visible from cache
- [ ] Verify "Offline Mode" indicator appears in top-right corner
- [ ] Filter events by type (verify filters work offline)
- [ ] Filter events by status (verify filters work offline)
- [ ] Search events by title (verify search works offline)
- [ ] Toggle between Active/History tabs (verify tabs work offline)
- [ ] Create new event offline (verify event appears in list)
- [ ] Edit existing event offline (verify changes appear)
- [ ] Delete event offline (verify event removed)
- [ ] Go back online
- [ ] Verify "Syncing" indicator appears
- [ ] Wait for sync to complete
- [ ] Verify "Synced" indicator appears
- [ ] Verify all offline changes synced to server

#### ✅ Navigation Between Pages Offline
- [ ] Load Calendar View while online
- [ ] Go offline
- [ ] Click "Event List" link (verify navigation works)
- [ ] Verify Event List works offline
- [ ] Click "Calendar View" link (verify navigation works back)
- [ ] Verify Calendar View still works offline
- [ ] Try clicking "Home" link (verify disabled/greyed out)
- [ ] Try clicking "Public Events" link (verify disabled/greyed out)
- [ ] Try clicking "Logout" link (verify disabled/greyed out)
- [ ] Verify offline badges (🚫) shown on disabled links
- [ ] Verify checkmarks (✓) shown on Calendar/Event List when offline

#### ✅ Offline Indicator Testing
- [ ] Start online - verify no indicator shown
- [ ] Go offline - verify yellow "Offline Mode" badge appears in top-right
- [ ] Create/edit/delete events - verify pending count increases
- [ ] Go back online - verify blue "Syncing" badge appears
- [ ] Wait for sync - verify green "Synced" badge appears
- [ ] Verify "Synced" badge disappears after 3 seconds
- [ ] Test on mobile device (verify indicator positioning)

#### ✅ Reconnection Spinner Testing
- [ ] Load PublicEvents page while online
- [ ] Verify shows "Loading Public Events"
- [ ] Go offline before page loads
- [ ] Verify shows "Attempting to reconnect to the server..."
- [ ] Repeat for CalendarList page
- [ ] Repeat for CalendarView page

#### ✅ Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with empty cache (first load offline)
- [ ] Test with multiple offline operations (create 3, edit 2, delete 1)
- [ ] Test conflict resolution (edit same event on two devices offline)
- [ ] Test interrupted sync (go offline during sync)
- [ ] Test rapid online/offline toggling
- [ ] Test with expired authentication token
- [ ] Test with browser storage disabled

---

## Performance Considerations

**Optimizations**:
- ✅ Offline-first loading reduces server load
- ✅ Filtering/searching happens client-side on cached data
- ✅ IndexedDB provides fast local storage access
- ✅ Minimal UI re-renders (only on state changes)
- ✅ Proper disposal prevents memory leaks

**Metrics** (Expected):
- Offline detection time: < 500ms
- IndexedDB save time: < 50ms
- Sync operation time: < 2s per operation
- Page load time: < 3s

---

## Known Limitations

1. **First Load Requires Online Connection**
   - Events must be loaded at least once while online to cache
   - Solution: User must visit pages while online first

2. **Conflict Resolution is Last-Write-Wins**
   - If same event edited on multiple devices offline, last sync wins
   - No conflict detection UI yet
   - Future: Add conflict detection and user choice

3. **No Offline Event Creation with Real IDs**
   - Offline-created events get temporary negative IDs
   - Real IDs assigned on sync
   - Works but could be improved

4. **Authentication Required for Sync**
   - Expired tokens prevent sync
   - User must re-authenticate
   - Future: Add token refresh

---

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1: User Requested
- [ ] Manual sync button
- [ ] Show sync queue UI (view/edit pending operations)
- [ ] Conflict detection with diff view

### Priority 2: Nice to Have
- [ ] Offline event creation with real IDs (UUID)
- [ ] Partial sync (sync only failed operations)
- [ ] Background sync using Service Worker API
- [ ] Persistent storage request (prevent browser eviction)

### Priority 3: Advanced
- [ ] Offline PWA installation
- [ ] Push notifications for sync completion
- [ ] Multi-device sync coordination
- [ ] Operation queue prioritization

## Maintenance Notes

### For Future Developers

**When Adding New Pages**:
1. Decide if page needs offline support
2. If yes, integrate `OfflineEventService` instead of `ApiService`
3. Add `ConnectivityService` and `SyncService` subscriptions
4. Add reconnection spinner to loading states
5. Update documentation

**When Modifying Services**:
- Maintain offline-first pattern
- Ensure error handling covers offline scenarios
- Update logging statements
- Test offline behavior thoroughly

**When Updating UI**:
- Ensure offline indicators remain visible
- Test on mobile devices
- Verify navigation menu updates correctly
- Check z-index layering for overlays
