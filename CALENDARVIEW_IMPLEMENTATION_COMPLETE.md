## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Warnings (Non-Critical)
- Build warnings about file locks when app is running (expected)
- Warnings removed: async methods without await, unused fields

### Current Limitations
1. **Confirm Dialog** - Uses placeholder (needs JSInterop for proper confirm)
2. **Join Event** - Stub implementation (needs API endpoint)
3. **Day Events Modal** - Code prepared but not yet implemented
4. **Participants Check** - Simplified (assumes non-organizer = non-participant)

### Recommended Future Enhancements
1. Add proper confirm dialog via JSInterop
2. Implement "Join Event" API endpoint
3. Add day events modal for date clicks
4. Add event participants management
5. Add event search/filter functionality
6. Add event recurrence support
7. Add calendar export (iCal)
8. Add event reminders/notifications
