- Users cannot modify any field when editing a joined event

**Hidden Update Button:**
- Update button is completely hidden for joined events
- Only "Cancel" button is shown
- Prevents any attempt to save changes to joined events

### 2. CalendarView.razor - Event Details Modal

**Visual Badges in Header:**
- Added "Joined Event" badge (green) with calendar-check icon
- Shows alongside "Public" badge if applicable
- Appears directly below the event title in the modal header
- Makes it immediately obvious when viewing a joined event

**Created By Information:**

- Displays with person-circle icon
- Shows for all joined events

**Hidden Edit Button:**
- Edit button is completely hidden for joined events

### 3. CalendarList.razor (Previously Added)

**Joined Badge on Event Cards:**
- Green "Joined" badge displays on event cards
- Shows alongside Status, Type, and Public badges
- Uses calendar-check icon

### 4. CSS Updates (calendar.css)

```css
.joined-badge {
    background: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.1);
    color: #10b981;
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Viewing a Joined Event:

1. **In Calendar Grid View:**
   - Event appears like normal events
   - Clicking opens the details modal

2. **In Event Details Modal:**
   - Title shown at top
   - **"Joined Event"** badge (green) displays prominently
   - "Public" badge also shows if applicable
   - "Created By" section shows original creator's name
   - All event details are visible (date, time, location, description)
   - Footer shows:
     - Informational text: "Joined events can only be deleted"
     - **Delete button only** (no Edit button)

3. **In Calendar List View:**
   - Event card shows **"Joined"** badge in green
   - Badge appears with other badges (Status, Type, Public)

### Attempting to Edit a Joined Event:

1. **From Details Modal:**
   - Edit button is not shown
   - Only Delete button is available

2. **If Edit Modal Somehow Opens:**
   - Orange warning banner appears at top
   - All form fields are disabled/grayed out
   - Cannot type or change any values
   - Update button is hidden
   - Only Cancel button is available

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme:
- **Joined Badge**: Green (#10b981) - represents successful join action
- **Warning Banner**: Orange (#f59e0b) - indicates restriction

### Icons Used:
- `bi-calendar-check` - For joined badge
- `bi-person-circle` - For created by info
- `bi-info-circle` - For informational messages

## Technical Implementation

### Condition Check:
```razor
@if (selectedEvent?.IsJoinedEvent == true)
```

### Disabled Form:
```razor
<fieldset disabled="@(isEditMode && selectedEvent?.IsJoinedEvent == true)">
    <!-- All form inputs -->
</fieldset>
```

### Hidden Button:
```razor
@if (!(isEditMode && selectedEvent?.IsJoinedEvent == true))
{
    <button type="submit">Update</button>
}
```

## Validation at Backend

The backend still enforces edit restrictions:
- `UpdateEventAsync` throws exception if `OriginalEventId.HasValue`
- Error message: "Cannot edit joined events. You can only delete them."
- This provides a safety net even if UI restrictions are bypassed

## Benefits

1. **Clear Visual Feedback:**
   - Users immediately know when an event is joined
   - No confusion about edit restrictions

2. **Multiple Indicators:**
   - Badge in list view
   - Badge in details modal
   - Warning in edit modal
   - Disabled inputs
   - Hidden Update button

3. **User-Friendly:**
   - Informational messages explain why actions are restricted
   - Delete action remains available for cleanup

4. **Foolproof:**
   - Multiple layers of prevention
   - Backend validation as final safeguard
   - Impossible to accidentally edit a joined event
